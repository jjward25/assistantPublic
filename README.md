Each "__Chat.py" file runs a local chatbot that uses local memory to add context to your conversations.  The taskChat bot can maintain a list of tasks and answer general queries, while other bots save entire chat sessions to maintain context over time.

To use these models first download Ollama (https://ollama.com/) and pull any models you want to use.
